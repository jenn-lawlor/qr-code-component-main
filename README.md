### What I learned

This was my first Frontend Mentor project. I practiced setting up a mobile-friendly card component using simple HTML and CSS.  

I also learned about a few best practices:  

```css
/* Keep box sizing predictable */
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* Make typography fluid with clamp() */
p {
  font-size: clamp(14px, 2vw, 16px);
}
```
